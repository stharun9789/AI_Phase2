## Data

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project is obtained from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing)) and is called "House Prices: 

Advanced Regression Techniques." You can download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/code).

### Data Description

The dataset consists of various features describing residential properties, including information like the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and more. The target variable is the sale price of the houses. This data is suitable for training and testing machine learning models for house price prediction.

## Training

Provide instructions on how to train the machine learning model. Include any training data preprocessing steps if necessary.

## Evaluation

Explain how to evaluate the model's performance. Mention metrics used for evaluation and any scripts or commands for this purpose.

## Configuration

If your project requires configuration settings, explain how to set them up. Include information on configuration files or environment variables, if applicable.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project. Include information about how to submit issues, pull requests, and any coding guidelines.

## License
